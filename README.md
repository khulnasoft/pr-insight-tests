## Try it now

Try the GPT-4 powered PR-Insight instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@KhulnaSoft-Insight` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The insight will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:
```
@KhulnaSoft-Insight /review
```
and the insight will respond with a review of your PR.

Note that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.
It does not have 'edit' access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@KhulnaSoft-Insight /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.


![Review generation process](https://www.khulnasoft.com/images/demo-2.gif)


To set up your own PR-Insight, see the [Installation](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/installation/) section below.
Note that when you set your own PR-Insight or use KhulnaSoft hosted PR-Insight, there is no need to mention `@KhulnaSoft-Insight ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.

4. **Extra features** -In addition to the benefits listed above, PR-Insight Pro will emphasize more customization, and the usage of static code analysis, in addition to LLM logic, to improve results. 
See [here](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/#pr-insight-pro) for a list of features available in PR-Insight Pro.



## How it works

The following diagram illustrates PR-Insight tools and their flow:

## Why use PR-Insight?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `"Why use PR-Insight? What makes it stand out from existing tools?"`

Here are some advantages of PR-Insight:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_insight/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Insight, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).


## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you host PR-Insight with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using PR-Insight Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro will use KhulnaSoftâ€™s proprietary models â€” if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” PR-Insight will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### PR-Insight Chrome extension

- The [PR-Insight Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-insight-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Insight tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Insight.
